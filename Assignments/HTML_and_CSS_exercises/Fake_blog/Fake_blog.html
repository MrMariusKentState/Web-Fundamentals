      The late Second City comedian Chris Farley is known for his portrayal of
      "Motivational Speaker Matt Foley" on Saturday Night Live. In the 'Matt
      Foley' skits, the character would be introduced to give advice on life,
      but would then launch into a tirade over how his life turned out poorly.
      He would frequently mock his audiences, and would constantly remind others
      he is now "living in a van down by the river!" Farley first introduced the
      Matt Foley character on stage at Second City (SC) with fellow SC alumnus
      Bob Odenkirk, who had created the Matt Foley character. The Matt Foley
      character later made its debut on Saturday Night in 1993. Chris Farley
      would go on to reprise the character six more times on SNL. His final
      reprisal would come in October 1997 - just two months before his tragic
      and untimely death.
